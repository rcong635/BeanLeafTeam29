Improved Capabilities:
In the profile page, users can view their caffeine intake day by day in the form of a chart. Merchants will now be able to view their sell history and edit and add locations. Merchants will now have to offer a form of proof to verify the authenticity of their shop to have it displayed on the map. Users now will also be able to order items from any store as long as they are close enough. After 400mg caffeine consumption for that day, the user will be warned with a message that they have exceeded the recommended daily limit.
